# AdventOfCode-2022
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) done in Rust.
**SPOILTER ALERT**, awnsers are listed at the bottom of the README.

## Project workings
This is the first time I'm using Rust so the setup will be messy for most. To run the code of a day do `cargo build` and `cargo run` in the folder of the day.
